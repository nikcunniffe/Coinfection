# Coinfection
Code for using the NiSP and NiDP models to test for interactions between pathogens from cross-sectional data

The code to fit the models is in modelFitting.R

The two files NiDP_Model_Example.R and NiSP_Model_Example.R show how to use them in practice

The directory howardData is the data extacted by chasing references from Howard et al. (2001)
